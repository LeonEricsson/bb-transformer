# **transformer**

Bare-bones implementation of the transformer architecture, as spelled out by Vaswani et al. in the already classic paper [**Attention is all you need**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Nothing fancy about the implementation, I ran through the design strictly as an exercise tool to build deeper understanding of the architecture. Fully implemented as custom PyTorch modules.
